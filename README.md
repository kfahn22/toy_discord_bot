# Install dependencies
- `npm install discord.js`
- `npm install dotenv`
- `npm install undici`
 

## Use SlashCommandBuilder class to add command definitions
- The name of the file is the name of the slash command
- choochoo.js is /choochoo:  .setName('choochoo')
- description "Replies with emogies!":  .setDescription('Replies with emogies!')
- interaction.reply 'ðŸš‚ðŸŒˆðŸ’–'

##  Ephemeral response
- To limit response to user who issued the slashCommand use `ephemeral=true`
- [Guide](https://discordjs.guide/slash-commands/response-methods.html#ephemeral-responses)

## To deploy

### The file deploy-commands.js contains the code to run the files in the commands folder.  At present the files cat.js (returns a random cat gif), choochoo.js, and hello.js work as expected. 

- `node deply-commands.js` 
- `node index.js`
